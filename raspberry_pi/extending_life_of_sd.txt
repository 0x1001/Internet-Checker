SD Cards have limited number of writes which is quit small compared to flash drivers or ssd drives.
To extend its live few steps can be done:

1. Mount /tmp folder to RAM
In /etc/fstab:
none            /tmp            tmpfs   size=10M,noatime  0       0

2. Mount /var/log to RAM
In /etc/fstab:
none            /var/log        tmpfs   size=10M,noatime  0       0

3. Make sure 'noatime' is in /etc/fstab for SD card mounts. This disables access time update during read.

4. Remove swap.
On some distributions remove appropriate entry from /etc/fstab
For Raspbian use:
sudo swapoff --all
sudo apt-get remove dphys-swapfile

5. There are other this you can do: 
Mount file system as read only.
Disable journaling by mounting ext4 as ext2
Use external storage (flash drive or netowrk drive)
